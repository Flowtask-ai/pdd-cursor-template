# Generated PRPs

This folder contains the Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs) that are automatically generated from your PRDs.

## How PRPs are Created

1. PRPs are generated automatically when you run the command: "Generate a PRP from PDD/PRDs/requests/your-file.md"

2. The generated PRP will be saved here with the same name as the source PRD

3. Each PRP contains:
   - Complete implementation blueprint
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Validation criteria
   - Success metrics

## Usage

1. After a PRP is generated, you can execute it with: "Execute the PRP in PDD/PRPs/generated/your-file.md"

2. The AI will follow the PRP to implement your feature systematically

3. Generated PRPs are based on the template in `../templates/prp-base.md`

## File Organization

- PRPs maintain the same naming convention as their source PRDs
- Each PRP is a comprehensive, AI-ready implementation guide
- PRPs can be modified if needed before execution

## Next Step

Once your PRP is ready, execute it and follow the workflow as described in the main README and USAGE_GUIDE.md.
