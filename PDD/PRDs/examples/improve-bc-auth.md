# Improve Bounded Context: Authentication System

## 🎯 Improvement Overview
**BC Name**: Authentication System
**Improvement Type**: Security, Performance, Code Quality
**Current Issues**: Outdated JWT implementation, slow password hashing, poor error handling, missing rate limiting, no audit logging

## 🔍 Analysis Areas
**Code Quality**: Improve error handling, add comprehensive logging, refactor authentication service
**Performance**: Optimize password hashing (bcrypt to Argon2), improve JWT token validation speed
**Security**: Implement rate limiting, add audit logging, enhance input validation, add 2FA support
**Architecture**: Separate concerns, improve dependency injection, add service layer patterns
**Technical Debt**: Update dependencies, remove deprecated code, improve test coverage

## 🎯 Improvement Goals
1. **Security Enhancement**: Implement rate limiting, audit logging, and 2FA support
2. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce authentication response time by 50%
3. **Code Quality**: Achieve 95% test coverage and improve maintainability
4. **Modern Standards**: Update to latest security best practices and dependencies

## 📊 Current State Assessment
**Performance Metrics**: Average auth response time: 800ms, Password hash time: 300ms
**Security Status**: Basic JWT implementation, no rate limiting, minimal audit logging
**Code Quality Score**: 65% test coverage, 3 security vulnerabilities detected
**Technical Debt Level**: High - outdated dependencies, deprecated patterns

## 🔧 Improvement Strategy
**Phase 1**: Security improvements (rate limiting, audit logging, input validation)
**Phase 2**: Performance optimization (Argon2 hashing, JWT optimization, caching)
**Phase 3**: Architecture refactoring (service layer, dependency injection, 2FA)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive unit tests for all authentication flows
- Integration tests for rate limiting and security features
- Performance tests to validate improvements
- Security tests for vulnerability assessment
- Load testing for rate limiting validation

## 📚 Examples to Follow
- Check `PDD/PRDs/examples/` for similar improvement examples
- Review `.cursor/rules/code-examples/` for implementation patterns
- Reference `PDD/customization-examples/` for your specific tech stack

## 🔗 Dependencies and Risks
**Dependencies**: Redis for rate limiting, updated dependencies, migration scripts
**Risks**: Breaking changes to existing tokens, potential downtime during migration
**Mitigation**: Gradual migration with backward compatibility, comprehensive testing
