# Generate PRP Command

## 🎯 Purpose
When the user requests to generate a PRP (Product Requirements Prompt), follow this structured approach to create a comprehensive implementation blueprint.

## 📋 Process

### 1. Analyze Request
- **Read the PRD file** completely (usually in `PDD/PRDs/`)
- **Identify all requirements** (functional, technical, constraints)
- **Review referenced examples** in `PDD/PRDs/examples/`
- **Check project patterns** in `.cursor/rules/code-examples/`

### 2. Validate PRD Quality
**Key Questions to Consider:**
- Is the description sufficiently specific?
- Have all relevant examples been included?
- Is the documentation complete and up-to-date?
- Have all edge cases been considered?
- Are the success criteria measurable?

**PRD Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] **Specific and detailed** about project/feature purpose
- [ ] **Technical requirements** and constraints included
- [ ] **Expected behavior** clearly defined
- [ ] **Examples referenced** from `PDD/PRDs/examples/`
- [ ] **Documentation URLs** for APIs and libraries included
- [ ] **Security considerations** where relevant
- [ ] **Success criteria** are specific and measurable
- [ ] **No vague descriptions** like "create a scraper"

### 3. Research Context
- **Search existing codebase** for similar patterns
- **Consult official documentation** for libraries mentioned
- **Identify best practices** and common gotchas
- **Review project architecture** and conventions

### 4. Create PRP Structure
Use this template structure:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Product Requirements Prompt

## 🎯 Purpose and Context
- Clear objective description
- Project context and architecture overview
- Business justification

## 📋 Technical Requirements
- Detailed specifications
- Dependencies and libraries
- Configuration requirements
- Performance constraints

## 🏗️ Architecture and Design
- File structure proposal
- Design patterns to follow
- Integration with existing code
- Data models and relationships

## 📝 Implementation Plan
1. **Step 1**: [Specific action]
   - Validation: [Command to run]
2. **Step 2**: [Specific action]
   - Validation: [Command to run]
   [Continue for all steps]

## 🧪 Testing and Validation
- Unit testing strategy
- Integration testing approach
- Acceptance criteria
- Performance benchmarks

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] All functionality implemented
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code follows project patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regressions introduced
```

## 🔍 Quality Checklist
- [ ] **Complete context**: All necessary information included
- [ ] **Clear steps**: Implementation steps are specific and actionable
- [ ] **Executable validations**: Commands that can be run and verified
- [ ] **Correct references**: Files and patterns that actually exist
- [ ] **Measurable criteria**: Success can be objectively verified

## 📊 Confidence Scoring
Rate the PRP quality (1-10) based on:
- **Context completeness** (1-3 points): All requirements covered
- **Implementation clarity** (1-3 points): Steps are clear and specific
- **Validation quality** (1-2 points): Tests and checks are comprehensive
- **References accuracy** (1-2 points): All files and patterns exist

## 📤 Output
- **Save PRP** in `PDD/PRPs/[feature-name].md`
- **Include confidence score** and justification
- **Reference the template** in `PDD/PRPs/templates/prp-base.md`

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing PRDs
- **Use precise technical language** but understandable
- **Provide sufficient context** to understand the problem
- **Include usage examples** when possible
- **Specify constraints** and limitations clearly

### Information Organization
- **Group related information** in logical sections
- **Use lists and tables** for structured information
- **Include direct links** to external resources
- **Maintain consistent formatting** with the rest of the project

### PRP Generation
- **Be specific**: Avoid vague descriptions
- **Include examples**: Reference existing patterns
- **Anticipate problems**: Address common issues
- **Validate references**: Ensure all files exist
- **Follow project conventions**: Use established patterns
