# CI/CD Pipeline Rules

## üöÄ Pipeline Structure

### Build Stage
- Compile and build application
- Run static code analysis
- Execute unit tests
- Generate code coverage reports
- Create build artifacts

### Test Stage
- Run integration tests
- Execute E2E tests
- Perform security scanning
- Run performance tests
- Validate deployment artifacts

### Deploy Stage
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run smoke tests
- Perform user acceptance testing
- Deploy to production
- Monitor deployment health

## üõ†Ô∏è CI/CD Tools

### Build Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub-based CI/CD
- **GitLab CI**: GitLab-based CI/CD
- **Jenkins**: Self-hosted CI/CD
- **CircleCI**: Cloud-based CI/CD
- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft CI/CD

### Container Tools
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package manager
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container applications
- **Buildah**: Container building

### Deployment Tools
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Ansible**: Configuration management
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: AWS deployment
- **Azure App Service**: Azure deployment
- **Google Cloud Run**: GCP deployment

## üìã Pipeline Configuration

### Environment Management
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper secret management
- Use feature flags for deployments
- Maintain environment parity
- Implement proper rollback strategies

### Security Integration
- Scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Implement security testing in pipeline
- Use secure artifact storage
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor security compliance

### Quality Gates
- Automated test execution
- Code coverage thresholds
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks
- Code quality metrics

## üîÑ Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Deploy new version alongside existing
- Switch traffic when ready
- Enable quick rollback
- Minimize downtime
- Test in production-like environment

### Canary Deployment
- Deploy to small subset of users
- Monitor performance and errors
- Gradually increase traffic
- Rollback if issues detected
- Validate in production

### Rolling Deployment
- Deploy incrementally across instances
- Maintain service availability
- Monitor deployment progress
- Implement health checks
- Enable automatic rollback

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- Monitor application performance
- Track error rates and exceptions
- Monitor user experience metrics
- Implement proper logging
- Use distributed tracing

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Monitor server resources
- Track network performance
- Monitor database performance
- Implement alerting systems
- Use infrastructure as code

### Business Metrics
- Track business KPIs
- Monitor user engagement
- Track conversion rates
- Implement A/B testing
- Use analytics tools

## üîê Security and Compliance

### Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Infrastructure security scanning
- Code security analysis
- Compliance checking

### Access Control
- Implement proper IAM policies
- Use least privilege principle
- Implement audit logging
- Use secure communication
- Monitor access patterns
